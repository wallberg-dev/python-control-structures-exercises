Python solutions to control structure exercises from UBA's Computational Thinking course

# Guide 3 – Control Structures  
University of Buenos Aires – Introduction to Computational Thinking

This repository contains my solutions for Guide 3 from the course *Introduction to Computational Thinking* at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA).

## Topics Covered

- Conditional structures (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Boolean logic and decision-making
- Looping with `for` and `while`
- Functions with and without parameters
- Input validation
- Problem-solving through structured logic
- Exercises with and without user input

All exercises include the original instructions as comments in the file `GUIA3.py`.

## Personal Note

This project is part of my training as a Computer Engineering student at UBA.  
I'm currently building my technical profile by solving exercises in Python. More guides, LeetCode practice, and personal projects will be added progressively.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the file `GUIA3.py`.
2. Open it with your preferred code editor (for example, VS Code or PyCharm).
3. Exercises are organized as commented blocks. Uncomment and run the code to test each one.
4. For exercises that require input, you can either provide parameters or temporarily enable `input()`.
